  Welcome to LA CTF 2024! We hope that you enjoy our challenges and learn while doing so.

  Shameless plug: during the competition on Saturday, we will be hosting talks from UCLA Professors as well as Samy Kamkar (who wrote the MySpace worm) that will be streamed online, or visit us in-person on the UCLA campus. Come check them out! See [https://static.lac.tf/schedule.pdf](https://static.lac.tf/schedule.pdf) for more information about the in-person event schedule.

  Please take this time to read the rules, which is on the home page of the platform (the site you are on right now). You can find the flag somewhere inside the rules. You MUST solve this challenge in order to be eligible for prizes.
