I just invented the best shuffling algorithm!
Nobody can read this!
Here, let me hide a flag here: lactf{th3_h0us3_c0uld_n3v3r_l0se_r1ght}
I better not see anyone try to lay their three fingers sideways (mod m) and declare "with this breath, I determine a to be congruent to (X_2 - X_3)/(X_2 - X_1) and c to be trivial"
I mean, it's surely impossible to decipher this message right
I'm going to sell this algorithm to every casino ever and get rich mwahahahaha
