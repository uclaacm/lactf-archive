  Check out this new open-source version of Minecraft my friend is making! They started working on it yesterday, but I want to speedrun it before anyone else can ... can you find me a seed that makes the end portal complete? Run the game with `java -jar my-new-game.jar`.

  Send your seed to `{{nc}}` to get the flag.

flag:
  file: flag.txt

provide:
  - ./dist.tar.gz

containers:
  main:
    build: .
    replicas: 1
    ports:
      - 5000
    securityContext:
      privileged: true

expose:
  main:
    - target: 5000
      tcp: 31170
