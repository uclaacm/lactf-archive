  Happy Valentine's Day! I'm unfortunately spending my Valentine's Day working on my CS131 homework. I'm getting bored so I wrote something for my professor. To keep it secret, I encrypted it with a Vigenere cipher with a *really* long key (161 characters long!)

  As a hint, I gave you the first part of the message I encrypted. Surely, you still can't figure it out though?

  Flag format is lactf{xxx} with only lower case letters, numbers, and underscores between the braces. 

flag: "lactf{known_plaintext_and_were_off_to_the_races}"

provide:
  - ./intro.txt
  - ./ct.txt
