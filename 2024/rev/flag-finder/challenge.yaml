  Speak with the almighty flag. Perhaps if you find an item it likes, it will be willing to share some of its knowledge? I'm sure it's in the room somewhere...
  Note: Enter the flag using all lowercase. M1/M2 Macs must use Rosetta.

flag: "lactf{k3y_to_my_h34rt}"

provide:
  - ./FlagFinderWindows.zip
