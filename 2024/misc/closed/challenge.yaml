  Over spring break, my friend sent me this picture of a place they went to, and said it was their favorite plate to visit but it closed :(.

  Where is this rock?

  Answer using the coordinates of the bottom left corner of the rock, **rounded** to the nearest thousandth. If the coordinates were the [physical location of the bruin bear statue](https://www.google.com/maps/place/34%C2%B004'15.5%22N+118%C2%B026'42.0%22W/@34.0710041,-118.4450305,39m/data=!3m1!1e3!4m4!3m3!8m2!3d34.070968!4d-118.445002?entry=ttu), the flag would be `lactf{34.071,-118.445}`. Note that there is no space in the flag.

flag: 'lactf{36.516,-121.949}'
