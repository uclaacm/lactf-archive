# OOPS!

I uploaded [this file](message.wav) as part of the challenge, but this is actually the recovered wav file after demodulating/processing the audio, and in here the flag is audible. I meant to upload [this file](true-message.wav) for the challenge, where the flag instead isn't audible. Sorry about that!
