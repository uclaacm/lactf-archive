  I found this really fun datapack! If you give it the flag (somehow??), you get a special prize! Unfortunately, the datapack is very inconveniently long.... ;)

  NOTE: this datapack is compiled for Minecraft version 1.20.4. It will likely not work on other versions. Also, when loading the datapack on a Minecraft 1.20.4 client, it may tell you the datapack is outdated; ignore this message. The datapack will work.

  NOTE: You DO NOT need to purchase Minecraft to solve this challenge. You can download a free Minecraft server .jar [here](https://mcversions.net/) to test commands and data packs, without purchasing an account. There are also many open-source Minecraft bot clients that can log into an *offline* server without needing authentication.
