AAAAA

Here’s AAAAA a thing AAAAA that happened to one of my friends. I was there. AAAAA

Basically, we were walking down the sidewalk, talking about something meaningless. I think it had to do with a movie AAAAAA.

Then this bus screeches up, stops AAAAA next to us, and a bunch of people with “Down with Cis” AAAAAA shirts climbed out and started beating him up. I was punched and kicked a bit too, but I managed to avoid brutalization by going for their faces.

I shouted "AAAAA lactf{down_with_cis_bus}!"

After figuring out what’s AAAAA happening, I started attacking them back, getting them off of him.

He was quite AAAAA injured but I called nine-one-one and he made a full recovery at the AAAAA hospital. I was fine, with only a cut on my arm that they patched up.
