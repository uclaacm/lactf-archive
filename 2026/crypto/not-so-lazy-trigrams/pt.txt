There's a relatively simple way to understand why a polarizer that creates a specific direction of circularly polarized light will pass that same polarized light. First, considering the bidirectional usefulness of this image, imagine the circularly polarized light shown above still exiting the quarter-wave plate and moving to the left. Observe that if the horizontal component of the linearly polarized light is delayed twice by a quarter of a wavelength (which is equivalent to a full half-wavelength), the resulting linearly polarized light will be at a right angle to the incoming light. If this perpendicularly polarized light is rotated in the horizontal plane and passed again through the linear polarizer section of the circular polarizer, it will clearly pass through given its orientation. Now, imagine the circularly polarized light that has passed through the quarter-wave plate once, been rotated, and directed back towards the circular polarizer. Let's assume the circularly polarized light shown above now represents this light. This light will pass through the quarter-wave plate a second time before reaching the linear polarizer, and in this process, its horizontal component will be delayed a second time by a quarter of its wavelength. Whether this horizontal component is delayed by a quarter of a wavelength in two separate steps or by a full half wavelength in one go, the direction of the resulting linearly polarized light will be such that it passes through the linear polarizer. lactf{still_too_lazy_to_write_a_plaintext_so_heres_a_random_wikipedia_article}
