  I was hiking in the woods when I stumbled across this amazing thing: thousands of these orange structures! I stopped to take a photo but then this cat *had* to photo bomb my otherwise perfect photo with it's tail! Can you find where this photo was taken?

  Move to the exact location where this photo was taken in Google Street View, and then submit the coordinates (latitude and longitude) from the url in the format `lactf{LAT,LONG}`.

  For example, if the photo [celebrating the anniversary of the Bruin Bear statue](https://alumni.ucla.edu/event/the-bruin-bear-statue-anniversary/) was the target photo, then [this](https://maps.app.goo.gl/YTt69MqjjUZAxVS58) would be the correct Google Street View location, and the answer to submit would be `lactf{34.0710103,-118.4449715}`.
