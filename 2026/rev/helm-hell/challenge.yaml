  I was migrating our CTF infrastructure over to Helm charts instead of our artisan hand-crafted Kubernetes manifests we've been using for years, but I think I messed up the templates, and now it always outputs false whenever I try and render the templates `._.`. Can you help me figure out how to get it to output true?
