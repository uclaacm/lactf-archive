    I don't really understand why people choose big numbers that can't be factored. No one has been able to crack my RSA implementation even though my modulus is factorable. It should just be normal RSA??? All I did was make it faster. I've asked my friends and the only feedback I've gotten so far are rave reviews about how secure my algorithm is. Hmm, maybe I'll name it the Ravin Cryptosystem. There better not be anyone with a similar idea.
