# LA CTF 2023 Archive
Welcome! You can find all of the challenges and their corresponding files, including some with solve scripts or notes and source code, in this folder. Most challenges that require running a service can be run using the provided dockerfiles (`docker build . -t NAME && docker run -p OUTSIDEPORT:INSIDEPORT NAME`), or if a `docker-compose.yaml` file exists, `docker compose up` on docker desktop or `docker-compose up` otherwise.

If you were redirected here after clicking a link from the challenge platform, the challenges are no longer up and running. Please use these files instead.

If you have any questions, please feel free to join our discord at [https://lac.tf/discord](https://lac.tf/discord)!
